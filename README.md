# Neocognitron Implementation with Visualization and Persistence

This repository contains an implementation of Fukushima's Neocognitron from the 1988 paper, a hierarchical neural network for pattern recognition. This version includes additional features for visualizing the output of the C layer for each plane and storing the trained network using Python's pickle module.

## Features
- **C Layer Visualization**: Outputs of the C layers can be visualized per plane to aid in debugging and understanding the network's feature extraction.
- **Network Persistence**: The trained network is saved in a `.pkl` file, allowing for easy loading and reuse without retraining.
- **Hierarchical Feature Extraction**: Implements alternating S (simple) and C (complex) layers inspired by biological vision systems.

## Installation
To use this implementation, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

### TODO
Revalance the data set and documentation of the code.
